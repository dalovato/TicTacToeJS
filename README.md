# TicTacToeJS

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe web application that allows a human to either play against a computer. The computer has two settings: easy and hard.  The easy setting is the computer just playing randomly, while the hard setting is the computer playing as best as they can.  In fact, on the hard setting the computer cannot be beat, only tied.  This is because it uses a Minimax algorithm to determine the best move possible.  Since Tic-Tac-Toe is a relatively simple game with few moves, it can always tie the user.
